# make customers happy with spock

I am aware that the title is assertive. Completely my thoughts, but I think it's correct.

Developers, feel happy writing a test with Spock. 
I recently told my pair(lemi) that I was very happy to write Spock tests. He replied, "I'm happy too."Â 

When developers are happy, they build the right things right. Therefore customers will be happy.
